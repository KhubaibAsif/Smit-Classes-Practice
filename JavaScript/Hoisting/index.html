      JavaScipt Hoisting is the behavior where the interpreter moves funtion and
      variable declaration to the top of their respective scope before
      executing the code. This allows variable to be accessed before
      declaration, aiding in more flexible coding practice and avoiding
      "undefined" errors during executing
